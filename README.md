## 🎴 Card Database Format

`MLP-DB.json` is a JSON array of card objects:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "BP01-CR01",
    "name": "Twilight Sparkle",
    "type": "Character",
    "subtype": ["Unicorn", "Twilight Sparkle"],
    "color": "Purple",
    "cost": 4,
    "power": 5,
    "rarity": "CR",
    "deck": "BP01",
    "ability": "Appear If there is any Event in your Retirement Area, choose 1 Character in Rival's Adventure Area, it gets -3 Inspiration until the end of turn.",
    "story_stage": null
  }
]
```

### Card Types
| Type | Zone | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `Main Character` | MC slot | Exactly 1 per deck |
| `Character` | Main Deck | Max 4 copies |
| `Event` | Main Deck | Max 4 copies |
| `Item` | Main Deck | Max 4 copies |
| `Scene` | Scene Deck | Unlimited |
| `Story` | Story Deck | Requires `story_stage`: `"I"` / `"II"` / `"III"` / `"IV"` |

### Colors
| Color | Icon |
|-------|------|
| Purple | 🌟 |
| Indigo | 💎 |
| Yellow | 🦋 |
| Pink | 🎈 |
| Orange | 🍎 |
| Blue | ⚡ |
| White | ⬜ |

### Rarity Tiers (sort order)
| Code | Full Name |
|------|-----------|
| CR | Colorful Rare |
| GR | Gold Rare |
| SR | Silver Rare |
| U | Uncommon |
| C | Common |
| RR | Ruby Rare |
| ER | Emerald Rare |
| SPR | Sapphire Rare |
| ※CR | Shining Colorful Rare |

> Cards with a `※` prefix are special alternate-art variants (e.g. `※BP01-GR01`). They share the same name but have different artwork.

---

## 🔄 Updating the Database

1. Edit `MLP-DB.json` with new card data
2. Add new card images to the `cards/` folder — filename must match the card `id` exactly (e.g. `BP01-CR01.jpg`)
3. Commit and push — the app updates live within ~2 minutes, no changes to `index.html` needed

> The Set filter auto-detects all deck codes from the JSON, so new sets appear in the filter automatically.
